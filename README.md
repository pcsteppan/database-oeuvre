## About
Database Oeuvre is an award-winning data visualization project that synthesized my interests in art history, programming, and design. 

It visualizes the the bodies of work produced by select painters, by way of reducing and chronologically presenting their artwork as quantized distributions of color. Database Oeuvre takes two forms: a book and a website.
